   * deathrate is now scaled according to time steps
- fixed several issues related to grid geometry (relevant for non-square grids)
- handling of alternative solutions with flux variability analysis
- diffusion and advection can be blocked for occupied cells
- corrected bugs related to continuing of simulations
- expanded tutorial
- renamed growth to biomass in arena@orgdat
